  <p>
    I hold a deep passion for crafting smooth interactive experiences, and there
    is no better language for user interaction than Javascript.
  </p>
  <p>
    JS was the first programming language that really interoduced me to the
    technology industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    My first tentative steps into this vast, wonderful world was through the
    lens of the HTML canvas element. I found that designing small games and
    animations was a great way to learn the language and develop on my early
    skillset.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fast forward and Javascript is a different language, and my skills have been
    battle-tested in the web domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    I find the ES6 improvements to the language and ecosystem have allowed the
    developer in the driving seat to be incredibly expressive.
