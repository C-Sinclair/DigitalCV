<Article title="Swift">
  <p>iOS development's programming language of choice.</p>
  <p>
    I actually really like Swift, its a hugely expressive language with a lot of
    similarities to Kotlin, but with a slightly differing take specifically
    around "Protocols" as they are called in Swift.

    My chance to play around with the Swift ecosystem was in my role at Wilxite.
    One of our clients in the insurance industry had a requirement for an iOS
    (and Android) app for use by their engineers onsite.

  <p>
    Developing this app gave me the opportunity to play with camera, geolocation
    and background synchronisation, as well as the typical authentication tasks
    which every enterprise application requires.
