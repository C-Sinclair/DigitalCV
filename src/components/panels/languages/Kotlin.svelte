<Article title="Kotlin">
  <p>
    When it comes to Android development, Kotlin is the absolute language of
    choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    My Kotlin experience comes professionally from my time at Wilxite. One of
    our clients in the insurance industry had a requirement for an Android (and
    iOS) app for use by their engineers onsite.
  </p>
  <p>
    Developing this app gave me the opportunity to play with camera, geolocation
    and background synchronisation, as well as the typical authentication tasks
    which every enterprise application requires.
