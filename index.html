                <p>In my current role at Wilxite, I am the lead developer on two major projects, and have assisted my team members on a wealth of others when assitance has been needed. 
                
                The first of which is an appraisal system targeting GP surgeries across the South West. Currently in Beta, the system is a CRUD web application written in PHP with a sprinkling of jQuery for the front end. 

                The aim of the application is for users to form a discussion with their line managers, and set targets and record meetings and experience. 
                
                With the target market being the health field, data protection and privacy have been a constant theme throughout the project. I have been required to work very closely with the client to achieve the exact desired outcome of the project.
                
                The second project is an App for both Android and iOS for a client who specialises in damaged property repairs. The aims of the app is for engineers to photograph and upload pictures of damage to the property and log the times taken on these visits.
