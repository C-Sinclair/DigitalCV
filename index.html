            <strong>Wilxite &lt;/&gt; Software Developer</strong>
            <div class="flex">
                <div class="imgHolder">
                    <img id="wilxite">

                <div class="text">
                    <p>In my current role at Wilxite, I am the Lead Developer on two major projects, and have assisted my team members on a wealth of others when required.</p> 
                    <p>Wilxite is a small software development company specialising in enterprise web applications. The majority of the business is for long-term clients which are kept on a rolling contract. These contracts are allocated throughout the team where we are responsible from project initiation through to testing and deployment.  </p>
                    <p>The first project assigned to me within my first month is an appraisal system currently in use by four GP surgeries across the South West. The aim of the application is for users to form a discussion with their Line Managers, set targets and record meetings and experience. </p>
                    <p>The system is a CRUD web application at its core, written in PHP with a sprinkling of jQuery on the front end. The specification for the work required me to place application security as highest priority, as the system would be in use in the medical field, an area in which data protection is of most sensitive importance. The Health Service, as with many other organisations, are firmly planted in the original factory software provided by the manufacturers for their machines. This meant in practice, that I had to provide backwards compatibility all the way to Internet Explorer 8. </p>
                    <p>I was determined for the User Experience to feel slick and intuitive, to minimise on the amount of time users would require to learn and begin adopting the system into their weekly routines. By implementing AJAX loading of new content without page refreshes, and careful browser history API manipulation, I believe this was achieved. </p>
                    <p>I was required to work very closely with the client to achieve the exact desired outcome of the project, involving leading on face to face weekly meetings, providing detailed regular project updates via e-mail and telephone support as needed.  </p>
                    <p>The second, more recent project I have devoted my attention towards has been in many ways completely different to the appraisal system. Written in Kotlin for Android devices and Swift for iOS, I have been building a mobile application for a client who specialises in property insurance cover. Engineers will use the app to log time on site and to photograph and upload images evidencing and cataloging damage. </p>
                    <p>I am also constructing the server API, written in PHP, which the devices shall communicate with. This has been an uniquely interesting project, unlike any I have worked on. This is in part due to the fact I have had full automany on all language design decisions, as Wilxite are primarily PHP web application specialists, and experience of writing for other platforms has been limited. I used my initiative to take my foundation knowledge to enterprise level development through independent study, in the exceedingly short time period of only four months. The project is due to begin testing at the end of March. </p>
                    <p>In my short time at Wilxite I have become a central member of the team, and an important voice of advice for team members and clients when new design ideas are being explored. </p>
