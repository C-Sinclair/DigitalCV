                    <p>
                        In my current position at Wilxite, my role takes me to all areas of the stack. The company builds predominantly LAMP stack applications with a sprinkling of JQuery for the frontend user interactions. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Whilst at Wilxite, I took lead on a project to develop both an Android and iOS version of an enterprise app for technicians involved in the home insurance industry. As no one at Wilxite was familiar with app development, I was tasked with learning how to write native mobile apps from scratch. I opted to use Kotlin and Swift respectively, and the experience of learning both very unique languages greatly improved my development skills. It is a proud career achievement that I was able to successfully deploy both versions, and that they are now currently in use in the field. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I have also been instrumental in moving Wilxite from using third party VPS hosting to an inhouse Kubernetes based solution. I originally pitched the idea to management when the need to move hosting providers arose. I knew that Kubernetes and the related cloud based technologies were taking the software world by storm, and more importantly, I could see the huge benefits that using such infrastructure involved.
